This repo documents some lessons in writing ethereum contracts.

If you are new to ethereum, you might want to start at the [nutshell](nutshell.md) doc which explains what ethereum is and its key concepts. The lessons below take you through setup, writing simple contracts and then on to more complex things.

If you want to contribute / fix anything I got wrong, feel free to submit a PR.

## Lessons
Lessons 1 & 2 will get you to a point where you can write basic contracts (hackathon mode).
Lessons 3 and onwards will just give you more experience.

1. [Setup](setup.md) - Installing the tools you will need.
